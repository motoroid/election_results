# Election results Module 3 Challenge**

## Overview of Project

### The purpose of this project was to determine, in addition to the winner's name, votes, and percentage: 
####  1. The voter turnout for each county
####  2. The percentage of votes from each county out of the total count
####  3. The county with the highest turnout

## Results

## Analysis & Summary

The County analysis code was very similar to the code that was used to determine the candidate information. 
By understanding who won the election and the county with the highest numbers, the election commission can infer 
where the candidate was most popular and even look to find voter fraud there.  

This code can be modified to verify that each voter ID was only used once, or to really see which country voted for which candidate.
